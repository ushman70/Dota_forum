This is a full stack application that uses a php, mysql backend. Php prints to the front end to enable communication between the frontend and backend. New threads can only be created by an admin, all users can comment and reply. A like/upvote system is implemented. While communicating from backend to frontend isn't difficult, frontend to backend is alittle tricky. Jquery's ajax method is used to make this possible. The comments, like, amount of users are stored in a mysql database. Whenever a user enters a thread, information is fetched from the database and displayed. This information includes: comments, likes, and replies. The application was not responsive to all viewports but mainly to the smartphone size(around 680px) and to 1920 x 1080px. When building I used XAMPP's apache and MYSQL modules to power my DB and enable PHP usage
